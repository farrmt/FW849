deforestation and forest fragmentation. Loss of habitat from these
consequences of anthropogenic disturbances has led to orangutans being
seriously threatened. Monitoring temporal trends of orangutans and what
impacts their abundance and distribution is necessary to prevent the
continue loss and possible extinction of many wild orangutan
populations. Habitat types and food (fruit) are seen as potential
drivers of orangutan distributions and might give an indication of which
areas should be protected.</div><div>The goal of this analysis is to monitor habitat and fruit covariates
that might determine orangutan abundance spatially and temporally. Using
a Bayesian framework I will estimate the mean abundance of orangutans
while accounting for detection using distance sampling methods. I will
then use the parameter estimates of habitat and fruit to predict
orangutan abundance.</div></div></blockquote><ol><li><div class="ltx_p">Present a brief descriptive or exploratory analysis of the data.
